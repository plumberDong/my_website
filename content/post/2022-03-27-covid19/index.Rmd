# Background

The Covid-19 global pandemic is a serious crisis for the whole world. According to [WHO](https://covid19.who.int/), more than six million people have died from it to date. 

Compared with other countries, China adopted most extensive and stringent containment measures, and thereby fewer people died from it directly. However, the confirmed COVID-19 death count is not a comprehensive measure of the total impact of the pandemic because it may be affected by some well known biases.

# Excess Mortality

**This article aims to calculate the excess mortality in China in 2021** to measure the total effect of the pandemic in 2021.

*Excess mortality* refers to the number of deaths reported during the COVID-19 pandemic compares to the deaths we would have expected had the pandemic not occurred:

$$
\text{excess deaths}_{2021} = \text{reported deaths}_{2021} - \text{expected deaths}_{2021} \tag{1}
$$

# Data and Measures

Building a model to estimate the *expected deaths* in 2021 requires annual death numbers in previous years. However, [China's National Bureau of Statistics](https://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=C01) has not reported them online. 

For this reason, I turn to estimate the *reported deaths* based on *total population at the year-end* and *death rate* which have been published by them.

I calculate the *reported deaths* in $year_t$ as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{reported deaths}_t &= \text{averge total population}_t \times \text{death rate}_t \\
& = \dfrac{\text{total population}_t + \text{total population}_{t-1}}{2} \times \text{death rate}_t
\end{aligned} \tag{2}
$$

The first line of equation 2 is a formula provided by CBNC. Because the *average total population* is unknown either, I use the mean of the total population at the end and the beginning of the year instead.

# Results

Figure 1 shows the the reported deaths(eatimated) from all causes. Obviously, the reported deaths in 2021 experienced a unusual increase of about 164,268, which is much larger than the confirmed COVID-19 death count that year.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.cap="The reported deaths(from all causes)", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("dat.csv") %>%
  mutate(pop_avg = slider::slide_dbl(pop_end, mean, .before = 1)) %>%
  slice(-1) %>%
  mutate(death_num = pop_avg * death_rate / 1e3)


dat %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(pop_avg, death_num)) %>%
  mutate(name = recode(name, "death_num" = "reported deaths", "pop_avg" = "average total population")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, color = name)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("1e4") +
  guides(color = "none") + 
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free_y", nrow = 2) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2002, 2021, 3)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020, color = "grey")
```

To calculate *excess mortality*, we need the *expected deaths* in 2021. I use a type of exponential smoothing methods proposed by [Gardner & McKenzie](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.31.10.1237) to predict it.

The point forecast of excess mortality is $13.6 \times 10^4$, which is the real impact of the pandemic in 2021:

```{r}
dat[,"death_num"] %>%
  ts(start = 2002, frequency = 1) %>%
  window(end = 2020) %>%
  holt(damped=TRUE, phi = 0.9, h = 1) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate_all(~dat[[20,"death_num"]] - .) %>%
  flextable::flextable() %>% 
  flextable::colformat_num(digits = 2) 
```

# Robustness

Is our estimation of *expected deaths* precise enough? We can evaluate the forecast accuracy by looking whether the model fits well in previous years.

In Figure 2, the red and blue curves represent expected and reported deaths respectively. The accuracy of our model appears pretty well since 2009 and it is exactly in 2021 a large residual pops out.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.cap="Reported deaths and expected deaths", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fit_exp <- dat[,"death_num"] %>%
  ts(start = 2002, frequency = 1) %>%
  holt(damped=TRUE, phi = 0.9)

fit_exp <- fit_exp$fitted

dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(fit = as.vector(fit_exp))

dat %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(death_num, fit)) %>%
  mutate(name = recode(name, "death_num" = "reported deaths", "fit" = "expected deaths")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, color = name)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("1e4") +
  guides(color = "none") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2002, 2021, 3)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020, color = "grey")
```
